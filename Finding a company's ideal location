-Happiness ranking to be less than 15

Queries:
SELECT 
 avg_temp,
 avg_commute,
 happiness_ranking
FROM city_data.cities
WHERE avg_temp BETWEEN 45 and 65
/* this query narrows it down based on the temperatures to the top 11 cities */
 AND avg_commute < 60
 /* this narrows it down to the top 8 cities where this company can lcoate to*/
 AND happiness_ranking <= 15
/* this query is the final query to find out and allows the company to decide between the two best cities that match what theyd ideally want in a location where they can start their company. */
