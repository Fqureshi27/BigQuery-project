# BigQuery-project
This project is mainly focused on helping a company choose the most ideal location to start their company at based on a dataset with the average temperature, commute and happiness of different cities.
SQL will be the main coding language used in this project and will have lines that explain the code to make it easier to understand.
Furthermore, this project will also include an alternate version of this prompt to showcase differnt results from the dataset.
